Submission format: Python code in ipynb format (Jupyter Notebook)

Write a function to get an employee’s name and his/her biweekly salary. If the biweekly salary is less or equal to $1000, 3.5% bonus, if between $1000 and $2000, 3.25% bonus, and if equal or more than $2000, 3% bonus should be added to the salary for gross income. Then 17.2% taxes and deductibles should be applied to (deducted from) gross income, in order to calculate the net income.
Finally the function should print a pay stub like:

Employee: “John Smith”
Salary: $ 1,800.00
Bonus: $ 58.50
Deductibles: $ 319.66
Gross Pay: $ 1858.50
Net Pay: $ 1538.83
